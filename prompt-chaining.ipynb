## Graph State

LATS is based on a  (greedy) Monte-Carlo tree search. For each search steps, it picks the node with the highest "upper confidence bound", which is a metric that balances exploitation (highest average reward) and exploration (lowest visits). Starting from that node, it generates N (5 in this case) new candidate actions to take, and adds them to the tree. It stops searching either when it has generated a valid solution OR when it has reached the maximum number of rollouts (search tree depth).
